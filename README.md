# Pokedex

![Pokémon Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/other/official-artwork/25.png)  
*A modern Pokédex application for exploring Pokémon data.*

## Description

This is a Pokédex project that allows users to browse, search, and view detailed information about Pokémon. It fetches data from the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/), a free and open Pokémon RESTful API.

Key features include:
- Listing Pokémon with pagination or infinite scroll
- Searching Pokémon by name or ID
- Viewing detailed stats, types, abilities, evolutions, and more
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

What I personally really like about this project is how you can see the actual id number of each Pokemon matches their Pokedex number.
Just a small detail I added.



## Technologies Used

- Frontend: [e.g. HTML/CSS/JS, etc.]
- API: [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/)
